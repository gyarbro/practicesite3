    <h3>My Interests and Favorites</h3>
    <p>I am currently reading <i>Remarkably Bright Creatures</i> by Shelby Van Pelt. I cannot seem to put it down!</p>
    <p>I love the color red.</p>
    <p>I enjoy being in the sun and listening to the sounds of bodies of water, even the pool.</p>
    <p>If I could travel year round, I would in a heartbeat.</p>

    <h4>Summer Curriculum Development</h4>
    <p>I am excited to attend the Summer Curriculum Development starting on Monday, June 23rd.</p>

    <h5>Why am I excited?</h5>
    <p>Even if you weren't asking, I'm going to share why. I am advising this year and cannot wait to see what our team will develop regarding one of my all-time favorite texts, <i>Frankenstein</i> by Mary Shelley.</p>
    <p>Needless to say, Shelley is my girl! I love reading <i>Frankenstein</i> because no matter how many times I read it, I always find an interesting new connection.</p>
